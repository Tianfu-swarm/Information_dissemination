# Information_dissemination
A demo to verify how information is disseminated in a swarm system. 
The simulation environment used is ARGoS3, but the code development is primarily done with ROS. This is because we use a package similar to ros_bridge to connect ARGoS with ROS. 
By purposefully triggering information to drive directed dissemination, this study analyzes how effective information spread influences a swarmâ€™s transition from random movement to aggregation.

# Start up

## Starting the simulation environment

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/argos3:/your_package/PATH/information_dissemination/lib
export ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH=/your_package/PATH/information_dissemination/lib/
argos3 -c /experiments/information_dissemination.argos
```


## Manual Test Robot
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r cmd_vel:=bot1/cmd_vel
```
