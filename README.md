# Information_dissemination
A demo to verify how information is disseminated in a swarm system. 
The simulation environment used is ARGoS3, but the code development is primarily done with ROS. This is because we use a package similar to ros_bridge to connect ARGoS with ROS. 
By purposefully triggering information to drive directed dissemination, this study analyzes how effective information spread influences a swarmâ€™s transition from random movement to aggregation.
